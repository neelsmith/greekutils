# greekutils #

This package provides a library for working with Greek texts using either the Unicode Greek character set or the alpha-numeric-punctuation subset of the TLG project's ASCII-only beta-code transcription. In addition to class methods that work directly on Greek Strings, it includes a GreekNode class for working with well-formed XML containing Greek text.
